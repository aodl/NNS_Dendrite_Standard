# Testing

Build commands use the production values from [deployment](../operations/deployment.md). Local
replica commands additionally use `DFX_IDENTITY=codex_local`, a local API/provider,
and root-key fetching `true`; production commands require root-key fetching `false`.

The Chromium gate uses `puppeteer-core` only as a development dependency and runs
Chrome 144.0.7559.96 from the digest-pinned
`ghcr.io/puppeteer/puppeteer:24.36.0` image. It serves the exact production export
and executes four independent scenarios: 1440×1000 desktop; 1440×1000 with Chrome
DevTools Protocol `Emulation.setPageScaleFactor` set to 2 and the resulting visual
viewport scale asserted as actual 200% page scale; a separately labelled 720×500
CSS-pixel `200%-equivalent reflow viewport` at page scale 1; and 390×844 mobile.
It captures bounded JSON evidence and
screenshots under `dist/browser-qualification`, fails on page/console errors or
material page overflow, and keyboard-focuses the copy, refresh, and Verify controls.
It records emulated screen and CSS viewport dimensions, device pixel ratio,
visual-viewport dimensions and scale, overflow, visible text/control counts, and
keyboard evidence. It also proves one primary row per distinct rule ID, the 15-topic
default-rule summary, all 15 instances after keyboard expansion, hidden empty group
headings under filtering, rejects preliminary controller passes, follows
section navigation without changing the neuron route, opens every lower disclosure at
every layout, and repeats overflow checks after interaction.
Each scenario independently requires at least one fixed-Governance v3 `query`, expected
query-signature `read_state`, no update endpoint, no unexpected canister, zero
production Dendrite requests, and zero interaction-triggered requests. Captured
transport headers contain no Authorization or cookies, but ingress anonymity is proved
by the separate production actor identity-construction unit test, not inferred from
those headers alone. The procedure never invokes Internet
Identity, clicks `Verify on-chain`, or sends an NNS mutation.

The Rust unit suite deterministically regenerates
`canisters/dendrite/web/test/fixtures/evaluator.json`. Its 32 cases record Rust overall
status, quorum and every rule status with stable names and timestamps. Frontend tests
apply the same named mutations to BigInt-safe browser evidence and require exact
policy-field equality. The cases cover compliant, missing/unavailable/contradictory
evidence, target posture, manager cardinality and availability, anchor/default/committed
following, quorum, controller evidence, source failures, and standard-update semantics.

Frontend state and presentation tests separately prove that every rule occurs once in
canonical order; all policy statuses have icon and text; unknown IDs fall back safely;
rule details, values, topics, local neuron links, copy controls, filters, bulk
disclosures, section summaries, empty/unavailable states, and accessible expansion
attributes behave without mutating the report. They also prove that route entry calls
Governance without calling Dendrite, controller-dependent preliminary rules cannot
pass, explicit verification calls Dendrite once, bounded verifier errors retain
preliminary evidence, route races remain suppressed, and authenticated transaction
controls require a current authoritative report. Existing transaction tests continue
to prove that final preflight independently invokes `check_neuron` and a failed
preflight sends no Governance mutation.

The 2026-07-28 candidate ran 135 frontend tests and 56 Rust unit tests plus 3 PocketIC
scenarios. Workspace Rust line coverage was 91.44% and rule-engine line coverage was
98.35%; frontend coverage was 97.22% lines, 88.19% branches, and 92.64% functions.
All 38 Rust/browser policy fixtures matched exactly. The executed Chromium evidence is
bounded non-release output under `dist/browser-qualification`.

### Troubleshooting

- Missing ID/origin or malformed alternative JSON: export every exact build input.
- Wrong Node/npm: select Node 24.15.0 and npm 11.12.1.
- Missing fixture Wasm: run `cargo xtask test`, which builds fixtures first.
- Docker/buildx unavailable: restore daemon access/buildx; do not substitute a local
  artifact as canonical.
- `icp-cli` identity mismatch: stop and select the reviewed production identity; never
  export identity material.
- Registry failure: retry only the build after registry recovery.
- Stale generated assets: rerun the configured frontend build and byte-identity tests.
- Dirty worktree: commit/review intended changes; the deploy guard intentionally fails.
- Release hash mismatch: rebuild canonically, regenerate `SHA256SUMS`, then update
  `icp.yaml`.
