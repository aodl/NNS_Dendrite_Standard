# Production record

**Status: INSTALLED — read-only application verification is incomplete.**

Only an operator-supplied real deployment result may change this into completed
evidence. Never include private identity or authentication material.

| Known limitations | `tools/scripts/verify-mainnet-readonly.sh` did not complete: its anonymous `icp-cli` controller-settings read was rejected, and direct follow-up verification found `/asset-manifest.json` returns HTTP 404. Other directly checked routes (`/`, `/index.html`, `/.well-known/ii-alternative-origins`, `/404.html`, and the hashed JS/CSS assets) return HTTP 200; the well-known document is exactly `{"alternativeOrigins":[]}`. |
| Operator notes | `icp-cli 1.2.0` remained the release and no-write dry-run client. No controller, freezing-threshold, or other settings change was made. No cycles wallet was used. All `dfx` management calls ran from a temporary directory outside the repository, which was removed; no dfx project configuration was introduced. No push, NNS mutation, or blackholing was performed. |
